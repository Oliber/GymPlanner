Learning about GUIs and applying it to this programming endevour made the experience really meaningful. 
The initial ideas around how my program would work has changed significantly. I first wrote a big chunk of my code
inside of a class which was the frame, then came along problems when i needed to switch panels to gather information to process.
I lessened the clutter by working out the order of panels and the information i had to gather. I strictly recalled that programming
is the art of breaking down problems into small managable tasks. This helped me reorganize my program and piece everything into a
main method.
