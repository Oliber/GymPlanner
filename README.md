# GymPlanner
This is my first Java project. I plan on expanding this basic Gym workout creator. This project is meant to be imported to a GUI
but I have not learned that yet and will do so soon. The GUI will help users really customize their workout instead of having a preselect workout.

Version The Very Basic :

All exercises pertaining to different muscle groups are saved in different text files.
These text files only contain the name of the exercise.
  Plan on adding a difficulty rating (on the exercise itself, there will be another for the rep range)
